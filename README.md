This repository contains code, data and documentation about my thesis titled "Empirical Asset Pricing via Deep Learning".
Using LSTM networks I am trying to predict one-month-ahead stock returns. My data contains fundamental and technical variables for companies over 40 years, macroeconomic variables for the same period and their interaction, totalling more than 900 variables. The dataset cannot be uploaded because of copyright concerns
