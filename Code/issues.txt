## Open Issues data processing

1. We need to clean the raw data by:
    - renaming variables appropriatly
    - Creating dummies
    - create direction variable

2. Split data:
    - We need to split data by company (obviously)
    - THEN apply the technical indicators! (In the stacked raw version we will get spilover for the first few observations) 
    - clean data: remove strings like ticker, close, high etc.
    - Save the data appropriately
    
the main problem occurs while looping through all the companies and applying the technical() function in the loop
